#Overview of Tasks:
# Financial Derivative Data Processing and Strategy Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive solution for extracting, processing, and analyzing financial derivative data. By leveraging APIs, user input, and trading strategies, users can effectively backtest and evaluate various trading methodologies across different timeframes. The project is designed for efficiency, using modern data handling techniques and performance metrics to assist in making informed trading decisions.

## Features

### Task 1: Data Extraction and Optimization
- **Data Extraction**: Fetches data from sources such as Telegram channels or the ICICI Breeze API using HTTP requests.
- **ZIP File Handling**: Extracts nested ZIP files to access raw data efficiently.
- **Data Partitioning**: Organizes data by year, month, expiry, and derivative type for easy access.
- **Efficient Storage**: Saves data in Feather format for quick read/write operations.
- **Indexing**: Applies indexing on expiry dates and strike prices for faster data retrieval.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filters contracts based on expiry dates using rolling windows.
- **Chunk Loading**: Loads data in manageable chunks to optimize memory usage.
- **Contract Rolling**: Implements functionality to roll over contracts automatically.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multiprocessing to handle large datasets effectively.
- **Redis Caching**: Caches frequently accessed data to improve performance.

### Task 2: User Input and Strategy Application
- **User Interaction**: Prompts users to select derivative types, timeframes, expiry dates, and trading strategies.
- **Data Filtering**: Allows users to filter data based on their selections.
- **Dynamic Strategy Application**: Applies predefined or custom trading strategies to the filtered data.

### Task 3: Trading Strategy Implementation
- **Moving Average Crossover**: Calculates moving averages and generates buy/sell signals based on crossover events.
- **RSI Strategy**: Computes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to generate trading signals based on market conditions.
- **Stop-Loss Logic**: Implements stop-loss and trailing stop-loss mechanisms to minimize trading risks.
- **Multi-Expiry Processing**: Filters and processes data for multiple expiries dynamically.

### Task 4: Strategy Backtesting
- **Resampling**: Resamples data into various timeframes (1 min, 5 min, 1 hour, 1 day) for analysis.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates key metrics such as total profit/loss, win rate, Sharpe Ratio, and maximum drawdown to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Provides results across different timeframes to assess the effectiveness of trading strategies.
